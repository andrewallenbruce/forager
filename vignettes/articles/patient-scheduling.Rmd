## Find ranges of dates when an apartment is empty

Adapted from this [`ivs` example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72536566/adding-rows-for-missing-intervals-between-existing-intervals-in-r/72547866#72547866)

-   Convert to dates rather than date-times
-   Add 1 to `end_date` to make ranges that match `[, )`, which is what `ivs` wants (and makes more sense here)
-   For each apartment, compute the interval *complement* with `iv_set_complement()`. These are the empty dates (it keeps in mind any overlaps)
-   Bind the complement with the original data and sort

The end dates in the final result will be +1 vs what is in your `desired_outcome` but I find these interval problems are easier to think about if you use right open intervals, `[, )`.

```{r}
example_dates <- structure(
  list(
    apartment = c("A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "C"),

## Find overlapping dates for each ID and create a new row for the overlap

 > I would like to find the overlapping dates for each ID and create a new row with the overlapping dates and also combine the characters (char) for the lines. It is possible that my data will have 2 overlaps and need 2 combinations of characters. eg. ERM

```{r eval=FALSE}

  geom_segment() + facet_wrap("ID", ncol = 1L) 
```

You can also use dplyr/tidyr along with the ivs package, which is a package dedicated to working with interval vectors like you have here. This allows you to combine your start/end dates into a single interval column and use a variety of iv_*() functions on it, here we use iv_identify_splits().

Understanding iv_identify_splits() can be a little tricky at first, so I'd encourage you to take a look at the graphical representation of that operation [here](https://davisvaughan.github.io/ivs/reference/iv-splits.html#graphical-representation).


```{r}
df3 <- tribble(
  ~ID,       ~date1,       ~date2, ~char,
  15L, "2003-04-05", "2003-05-06",   "E",
  15L, "2003-04-20", "2003-06-20",   "R",
  16L, "2001-01-02", "2002-03-04",   "M",
  17L, "2003-03-05", "2007-02-22",   "I",
  17L, "2005-04-15", "2014-05-19",   "C",
  17L, "2007-05-15", "2008-02-05",   "I",
  17L, "2008-02-05", "2012-02-14",   "M",
  17L, "2010-06-07", "2011-02-14",   "V",
  17L, "2010-09-22", "2014-05-19",   "P",
  17L, "2012-02-28", "2013-03-04",   "R"
) |>
  mutate(
    date1 = as.Date(date1),
    date2 = as.Date(date2)
  )

# Combine the start/stop endpoints into a single interval vector
df3 <- df3 |>
  mutate(interval = iv(date1, date2), .keep = "unused")

# Note that these are half-open intervals and you may need to adjust the end!
df3
```


```{r}
# For each ID, compute the "splits" for each interval.
# This splits on all the endpoints and returns a list column
df3 <- df3 |>
  group_by(ID) |>
  mutate(splits = iv_identify_splits(interval))

print(df3, n = 3)
```


```{r}
# Note how the total range of the splits vector matches the
# range of the corresponding interval
df3$interval[[1]]
```


```{r}
df3$splits[[1]]
```


![](https://davisvaughan.github.io/ivs/reference/figures/splits.png)


```{r}
# From there we can unchop() the splits column so we can group on it
df3 <- df3 |> unchop(splits)

# Note how rows 2 and 3 have the same `splits` value, so `E` and `R` will
# go together
df3
```


```{r}
# Group by (ID, splits) and paste the `char` column elements together
df3 |>
  group_by(ID, splits) |>
  summarise(char = paste0(char, collapse = ","), .groups = "drop")

## Aggregate counts by month from start-stop ranged variables

```{r}
enrollments <- tribble(
  ~unique_name, ~enrollment_start, ~enrollment_end,
  "Amy",        "1, Jan, 2017",    "30, Sep, 2018",
  "Franklin",   "1, Jan, 2017",    "19, Feb, 2017",
  "Franklin",   "5, Jun, 2017",    "4, Feb, 2018",
  "Franklin",   "21, Oct, 2018",   "9, Mar, 2019",
  "Samir",      "1, Jan, 2017",    "4, Feb, 2017",
  "Samir",      "5, Apr, 2017",    "12, Sep, 2018"
)

# Parse these into "day" precision year-month-day objects, then restrict
# them to just "month" precision because that is all we need
enrollments <- enrollments %>%
  mutate(
    start = enrollment_start %>%
      year_month_day_parse(format = "%d, %b, %Y") %>%
      calendar_narrow("month"),
    end = enrollment_end %>%
      year_month_day_parse(format = "%d, %b, %Y") %>%
      calendar_narrow("month") %>%
      add_months(1),
    .keep = "unused"
  )

enrollments
```


```{r}
# Create an interval vector, note that these are half-open intervals.
# The month on the RHS is not included, which is why we added 1 to `end` above.
enrollments <- enrollments %>% mutate(active = iv(start, end), 
                                      .keep = "unused")
enrollments
```


```{r}
# We'll generate a sequence of months that will be part of the final result
bounds <- range(enrollments$active)
lower <- iv_start(bounds[[1]])
upper <- iv_end(bounds[[2]]) - 1L
months <- tibble(month = seq(lower, upper, by = 1))
months
```

To actually compute the counts, use `iv_count_between()`, which counts up all instances where `month[i]` is between any interval in `enrollments$active`


```{r}
months %>% mutate(count = iv_count_between(month, enrollments$active))
```

  record_end_date = as.Date(c("2020-12-05", "2020-06-21", "2020-11-12"))
)

# Record the start and end months to generate the counts for
start <- date_start(min(ds$record_start_date), "year")
end <- date_end(max(ds$record_end_date), "year") + 1L

# Construct an interval vector

    .keep = "unused"

ds

  month = date_seq(
    from = start, 
    to = end, 
    by = duration_months(1)
  )
)

# Count the number of times `month[[i]]` is between any of the
# ranges in `ds$record_range`
result %>%
  mutate(
    count = iv_count_between(month, ds$record_range)
  )
```

Here's a solution that uses ivs (for interval vectors), clock (for month precision dates), and vctrs (for counting matches).

Note that ivs requires half-open intervals, which in practice means that we add 1 to our "end" months before creating the interval vector.

The real stars of the show are:

vec_count_matches() to count each time a month appeared in disease_date, which gives us our n_disease
iv_count_between() to count each time a month fell between a range, which gives us our n_total


```{r}
# Only need these cols
df <- df %>%
  select(start_date, end_date, disease_date)

# Turn into actual dates
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    across(everything(), \(col) {
      date_parse(col, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
    })
  )

# We really only need month based information, so drop the days
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    across(everything(), \(col) {
      calendar_narrow(as_year_month_day(col), "month")
    })
  )

# Turn the start/end dates into real ranges.
# Make them half-open ranges by adding 1 to the end date month
df <- df %>%
  mutate(range = iv(start_date, end_date + 1L), .keep = "unused", .before = 1)

df
```


```{r}
# Little helper to count the number of times each `needle` appears in `haystack`
vec_count_matches <- function(needles, haystack) {
  out <- vec_rep(0L, times = vec_size(needles))
  matches <- vec_locate_matches(needles, haystack, no_match = "drop")
  result <- vec_count(matches$needles, sort = "location")
  out[result$key] <- result$count
  out
}

# Create a full sequence from min month to max month
from <- min(iv_start(df$range))
to <- max(iv_end(df$range))

tibble(
  month = seq(from = from, to = to, by = 1),
  n_disease = vec_count_matches(month, df$disease_date),
  n_total = iv_count_between(month, df$range),
  prevalence = n_disease / n_total
)
```

Update: And with the dev version of ivs (what will soon be 0.2.0), this is even easier with iv_diff() and iv_count_includes(), which means you don't need the custom vec_count_matches() helper at all:



```{r}
tibble(
  month = iv_diff(seq(from = from, to = to, by = 1)),
  n_disease = iv_count_includes(month, df$disease_date),
  n_total = iv_count_overlaps(month, df$range, type = "within"),
  prevalence = n_disease / n_total
)
```


## Count instances of value within overlapping dates

I have a dataframe that includes start_date and end_date for a given unit_id along with the unit's group.

```{r}
data.frame(unit_id = c(1,2,3),
                 start_date = as.Date(c("2019-01-01","2019-02-05","2020-01-12")),
                 end_date = as.Date(c("2019-02-06","2019-02-28","2020-01-30")), 
                 group = c("pass","fail","pass"))
```

For each unit_id, I need to calculate the proportion of all units that pass within the duration, start_date and end_date for the current unit_id.

Taking unit_id=1 as an example, I need to find all units that have start_date and/or end_date within the dates for unit 1, i.e. start_date = 2019-01-01 and end_date = 2019-02-06. Given my in_df, this would return two units, 1 and 2. One unit passes and one fails so the proportion of pass would be 0.5. desired_df shows the output I expect for this example.

```{r}
data.frame(unit_id = c(1,2,3),
                 start_date = as.Date(c("2019-01-01","2019-02-05","2020-01-12")),
                 end_date = as.Date(c("2019-02-06","2019-02-28","2020-01-30")), 
                 group = c("pass","fail","pass"),
                 pass_prop = c(0.5,0.5,1))
```


I think ivs can help you, but I think you might be looking for iv_locate_overlaps() here:

```{r}
# Starting with the more complex example with the 4th row
in_df <- tibble(unit_id = c(1,2,3,4),
                start_date = as.Date(c("2019-01-01","2019-02-05","2020-01-12","2019-02-20")),
                end_date = as.Date(c("2019-02-06","2019-02-28","2020-01-30","2020-01-30")), 
                group = c("pass","fail","pass","pass"))

in_df <- in_df %>%
  mutate(range = iv(start_date, end_date), .keep = "unused")
in_df
```


```{r}
# "find all units that have `start_date` and/or `end_date` within the dates for unit i"
# So you are looking for "any" kind of overlap.
# `iv_locate_overlaps()` does: "For each `needle`, find every location in `haystack`
# where that `needle` has ANY overlap at all"
locs <- iv_locate_overlaps(
  needles = in_df$range, 
  haystack = in_df$range, 
  type = "any"
)

# Note `needle` 1 overlaps `haystack` locations 1 and 2 (which is what you said
# you want for unit 1)
locs
```


```{r}
# Slice `in_df` appropriately, keeping relevant columns needed to answer the question
needles <- in_df[locs$needles, c("unit_id", "range")]
haystack <- in_df[locs$haystack, c("group", "range")]
haystack <- rename(haystack, overlaps = range)

expanded_df <- bind_cols(needles, haystack)
expanded_df
```


```{r}
